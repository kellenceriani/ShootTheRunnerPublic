---New Main Menu---

I added a New Main Menu to my game with 4 different Reverb Sounds In the tunnels which will become gateways to each level in the game. 
I wanted each sound to simulate a different level hence why they are different. 
I also added a particle system and spin feature to a game object that I made grabble to start level one in the first tunnel. 
Eventually the goal is to get the Main Menu to Look like the outside of a baseball stadium where you use different tunnels to enter different levels on the same ballpark. This ballpark will be world 1 of several.



Current Sound Edits ReadMe:

In the recent commit I added five sounds and utilized four of them. The four that I used were: 
1. Ambient Crowd Noise which loops for two entire scenes. 
2. My game is a stationary game, so instead of a sound triggered by the users proximity, I added a sound from each runner that will change depending on which runner is active.
2a. This sound(the sound above) is also a looping 3D sound.
3. I've added a gun shot sound as well as a "death" sound when the bullet/ball hits the runner.

---Note--- I wasn't able to test these sounds because I don't currently have access to VR equipment, however I will test and add sounds in the near future.
